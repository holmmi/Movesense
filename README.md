# Movesense
A real use case project in studies.

Movesense device can be programmed to do the measurements independently via this application. Exact measurements can be then obtained from the Movesense. Viewing live data is also possible.

### What are the requirements to run this application?
A Bluetooth capable Android device and a Movesense sensor.
